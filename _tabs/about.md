Graduate of DAM and SMR, I am seeking a job opportunity that allows me to continue learning and growing professionally.

I consider myself a responsible person, capable of adapting and learning quickly in any work environment. During my training, I have acquired solid technical knowledge and experience in application development, and I am motivated to keep improving my skills.

My goal is to add value to the team while continuing to develop as a professional in the technology sector.

I am currently preparing for the eJPTv2 and CompTIA Security+ certifications.

I am writing this blog in English to practice the language.
