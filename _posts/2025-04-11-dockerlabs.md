Once we have Kali Linux installed, we need a CTF platform to practice our pentesting skills. For this tutorial series, I'm going to be using [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es/).

DockerLabs is a CTF platform with machines created in Docker. Easy to start, low resource consumption, and easy to delete. The platform was created by [@elping√ºinodemario](https://github.com/Maalfer), to whom we owe thanks for his passion and effort.
